A data structure for (hopefully) efficient file-editing operations like copy,
paste and insertions.

Maintain a tree, where each node is 'backed' by a buffer or a portion of a
file.  Then editing operation such as deletions and insertions can be done
efficiently by not changing the file or buffer, but rather by changing the
tree-overlay.

I've chosen to use a splay tree because for editing you could splay the node
we're editing to the root.  This makes modifications easier because you're
working on the root node.  Also splay trees are neat.
