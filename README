Rope file buffer package for fast editing operations on large files.

Maintain a tree, where each node is 'backed' by a buffer or a portion
of a file.  Then editing operation such as deletions and insertions can
be done efficiently, not by changing a file or buffer, but rather by
modifying the tree-overlay.
