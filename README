A data structure for efficient file-editing operations like copy,
paste and insertions.

Maintain a tree, where each node is 'backed' by a buffer or a portion of a
file.  Then editing operation such as deletions and insertions can be done
efficiently, not by changing a file or buffer, but rather by modifying the
tree-overlay.
